description: Panic recovery middleware to prevent server crashes in TurboGo.
---

#  Recovery Middleware

TurboGo includes a built-in recovery handler to catch unexpected panics and prevent application crashes.

---

##  Version

> This documentation refers to **TurboGo Recovery v1**.

---

##  Basic Usage

```go
app.Use(
  middleware.Recover(),
)
```

---

##  How It Works

- Wraps each request in a `defer-recover` block.
- If a panic occurs, it:
  - Logs the error and stack trace
  - Returns a safe 500 JSON error response

---

##  Example Error Response

```json
{
  "error": "internal server error",
  "message": "an unexpected error occurred"
}
```

And console logs:

```
[RECOVER] Panic recovered: runtime error: invalid memory address
[RECOVER] Stack trace:
...
```

---

## Use Cases

- Prevent app crashes from unhandled errors
- Debugging unexpected runtime issues
- Safer request handling in production
