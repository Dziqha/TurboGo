#  Auth Middleware

TurboGo provides JWT authentication middleware for protecting routes using `Authorization: Bearer <token>` headers.

---

##  Basic Usage

```go
app.Use(
  middleware.Recover(),
  middleware.AuthJWT("my-secret-key"),
)
```

---

##  How It Works

- Extracts the `Authorization` header.
- Validates JWT using HMAC SHA.
- Aborts request with `401` if the token is missing or invalid.
- Sets the first string claim into session: `c.SetSession("user", ...)`

---

##  Example Behavior

```http
Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
```

If token is valid, the request proceeds. Otherwise:

```json
{
  "error": "unauthorized",
  "message": "invalid token"
}
```

---

## Use Cases

- Protecting APIs with JWT
- User-based route access
- Token verification in chained handlers
