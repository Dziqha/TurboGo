#  Docker Support

You can containerize your TurboGo application easily with Docker for deployment or local development.

---

##  Dockerfile Example

Hereâ€™s a minimal `Dockerfile` to build and run your app:

```docker
# Use Go base image
FROM golang:1.24 AS builder

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .

# Build the binary
RUN go build -o server main.go

# Use minimal base image for final image
FROM debian:bookworm-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/server .

# Expose port and run
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["./server"]
```

---

##  Build & Run

```bash
docker build -t my-turbogo-app .
docker run -p 8080:8080 my-turbogo-app
```

---

##  Tips

- Use `ENV` or `.env` files for configuration.
- Mount volumes for logs or data if needed.
- Use multi-stage builds to reduce image size.
