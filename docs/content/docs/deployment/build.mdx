#  Production Setup

To run TurboGo in production environments, follow these steps:

---

##  Requirements

- Go 1.23+ is recommended for the latest features and performance.

- TurboGo is built on a custom engine based on fasthttp, designed for minimal allocations, high efficiency, and fast handler chaining.

---

##  Build Your App

```bash
go build -o app main.go
```

---

##  Behind Reverse Proxy

Use a reverse proxy to handle TLS, compression, and more:

- [**Nginx**](https://nginx.org/)
- [**Caddy**](https://caddyserver.com/)
- [**Traefik**](https://traefik.io/)

Example (Nginx):

```nginx
location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
}
```

---

##  Process Management

Keep your app running with:

- [**systemd**](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/) (recommended for Linux)
- [**PM2**](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) (Node.js process manager)
- [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/) container runtime

---

##  Monitoring & Logging

Integrate with:

- [**Prometheus**](https://prometheus.io/) for metrics
- [**Grafana**](https://grafana.com/) for dashboards
- Logging systems like [**Loki**](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/) or [**Logtail**](https://logtail.com/)
