# Project Structure

TurboGo uses a **feature-based architecture** to keep projects modular, scalable, and easy to maintain.  
This is the default folder structure generated when running `turbogo new`.

import { File, Folder, Files } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/files';

<Files>
  <Folder name="features" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="[feature-name]" defaultOpen>
      <File name="handler.go" />
      <File name="service.go" />
      <File name="repository.go" />
      <File name="router.go" />
    </Folder>
  </Folder>

  <File name="main.go" />
  <File name=".env" />
  <File name="README.md" />
</Files>

## Structure Highlights

- `features/`: Contains all application features. Each feature is fully self-contained.
- `features/[feature-name]/handler.go`: HTTP handlers responsible for handling requests and responses.
- `features/[feature-name]/service.go`: Business logic and domain rules.
- `features/[feature-name]/repository.go`: Data access layer (database, cache, external APIs).
- `features/[feature-name]/router.go`: Route definitions and feature-level middleware.
- `main.go`: Application entry point that initializes the app and registers all feature routers.
- `.env`: Environment variables such as `PORT`, `DB_URL`, and secret keys.
- `README.md`: Project documentation and usage instructions.

## Why Feature-Based?

- ✅ **Modular**: Each feature is independent and easy to reason about  
- ✅ **Scalable**: Add new features without touching unrelated code  
- ✅ **Maintainable**: Changes are localized to the feature they belong to  
- ✅ **Testable**: Each layer within a feature can be tested independently

## Generated with CLI

This structure is generated automatically when you run:

```bash
npx create-turbogo@latest my-app
```
