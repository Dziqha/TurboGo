#  TurboGo CLI

TurboGo provides a simple, flexible command-line interface (CLI) to generate starter projects and scaffolding instantly — powered by **Node.js**, not Golang binary.

---

##  Why Node.js CLI?

Unlike Go-based CLIs, TurboGo CLI is implemented in **Node.js** using tools like `commander`, `inquirer`, and `chalk` for:

- Better interactive prompts
- Cross-platform support (Windows/macOS/Linux)
- Easier development and fast iteration
- Ecosystem advantage (rich CLI UI tools)

> ⚠️ We intentionally use Node.js to overcome limitations of Go's CLI tooling, especially for rich interactive workflows.

## Installation

No need to install anything globally. Just run:

```bash
npx create-turbogo my-app
````

This will generate the default TurboGo project structure:

```bash
my-app/
├── main.go
├── go.mod
├── pkg/
│   ├── controllers/
│   └── routes/
└── ...
```

---

##  Features

* ✅ Generate full project boilerplate
* ✅ Clean folder structure (controller, router, entrypoint)
* ✅ Preconfigured `go.mod`, `.env`, `.gitignore`
* ✅ Optional dummy controller or auth setup

---

##  Use Cases

* Kickstart new TurboGo projects in seconds
* Save time scaffolding repetitive structure
* Ensure consistent architecture across teams

---

##  Example Command

```bash
npx create-turbogo myapp
```

Follow the prompt and your project will be scaffolded automatically.

---

## Pro Tip

After generation:

```bash
cd myapp
go run .
```

Start coding your next backend with the speed of TurboGo! 🌀
