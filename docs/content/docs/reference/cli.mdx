#  TurboGo CLI

TurboGo provides a simple, flexible command-line interface (CLI) to generate starter projects and scaffolding instantly — powered by **Node.js**, not Golang binary.

---

##  Why Node.js CLI?

Unlike Go-based CLIs, TurboGo CLI is implemented in **Node.js** using tools like `commander`, `inquirer`, and `chalk` for:

- Better interactive prompts
- Cross-platform support (Windows/macOS/Linux)
- Easier development and fast iteration
- Ecosystem advantage (rich CLI UI tools)

> ⚠️ We intentionally use Node.js to overcome limitations of Go's CLI tooling, especially for rich interactive workflows.

## Installation

No need to install anything globally. Just run:

```bash
npx create-turbogo@latest my-app
````

This will generate the default TurboGo project structure:

```bash
my-app/
├── features/
│   └── [feature-name]/
│       ├── handler.go       # HTTP handlers
│       ├── service.go       # Business logic
│       ├── repository.go    # Data access
│       └── router.go        # Route registration
├── main.go
├── .env
└── README.md
```

## Benefits of Feature-Based Architecture:

* ✅ Modular: Each feature is independent and self-contained

* ✅ Scalable: Easy to add new features without changing existing structure

* ✅ Maintainable: Code is easier to locate, understand, and modify by feature

* ✅ Testable: Each layer can be tested independently

---

##  Use Cases

* Kickstart new TurboGo projects in seconds
* Save time scaffolding repetitive structure
* Ensure consistent architecture across teams

---

##  Example Command

```bash
npx create-turbogo@latest myapp
```

Follow the prompt and your project will be scaffolded automatically.

---

## Pro Tip

After generation:

```bash
cd bisa
go mod tidy
Configure your .env file
go run .
```

Start coding your next backend with the speed of TurboGo! 🌀
