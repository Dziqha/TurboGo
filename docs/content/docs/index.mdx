#  Welcome to TurboGo

TurboGo is a modern, high-performance web framework for Go, designed with modularity, developer experience, and blazing-fast routing at its core.

Whether you're building REST APIs, background workers, or full-blown web services, TurboGo provides:

- Middleware-first routing with handler chaining
- Built-in queue system and pub/sub
- Context-based dependency injection
- Simple in-memory and file-based caching
- Minimal and flexible core for full control

##  What is TurboGo?

ðŸŒ€ **TurboGo** is a lightweight, middleware-first framework for building fast and scalable backend applications in Go.

Unlike traditional Go frameworks that tightly couple logic and routing, TurboGo gives you full control over execution flow using chained handlers, custom contexts, and built-in systems for queues and messaging â€” all designed to reduce boilerplate and improve modularity.

ðŸ”€ TurboGo Routing Philosophy
TurboGo introduces a custom Tiered Zero-Copy Routing (TZCR) model powered by a fast adaptive router. This design prioritizes speed by avoiding unnecessary allocations and resolving routes in a tiered fashion:

- Static, parametric, and wildcard routes are handled in separate tiers for minimal lookup time.

- Middleware and handlers are precompiled and chained efficiently with zero-copy context passing.

This approach results in ultra-fast response times, even under high concurrency, making TurboGo ideal for performance-critical APIs and microservices.
