##  What is TurboGo?

ðŸŒ€ **TurboGo** is a lightweight, middleware-first framework for building fast and scalable backend applications in Go.

Unlike traditional Go frameworks that tightly couple logic and routing, TurboGo gives you full control over execution flow using chained handlers, custom contexts, and built-in systems for queues and messaging â€” all designed to reduce boilerplate and improve modularity.
