#  Configure Cache

TurboGo provides a lightweight built-in caching system that stores responses in memory with optional TTL (time-to-live).

By default, **all `GET` routes are cached for 5 minutes** unless explicitly overridden. Other HTTP methods (`POST`, `PUT`, etc.) are **not cached** unless `.Cache()` is used.

---

##  Structure Integration

```plaintext
pkg/routes/router.go
```

This is where routes are registered and caching behavior is configured using `.Cache(ttl)` or `.NoCache()`.

---

##  How It Works

- `GET` routes are automatically cached for 5 minutes (300 seconds).
- Non-GET methods are never cached by default.
- You can override caching behavior per route using `.Cache(duration)` or disable it with `.NoCache()`.

---

##  Example Usage

```go
r.Get("/home", HomeHandler) // Cached by default for 5 minutes
r.Get("/blog", BlogHandler).Cache(2 * time.Minute)
r.Get("/stats", StatsHandler).NoCache()
r.Post("/submit", SubmitHandler).Cache(1 * time.Minute) // Enable cache manually
```

## Behind the Scenes

TurboGo uses an in-memory cache engine optimized for high-throughput web applications.  
It is built with safe concurrency mechanisms and automatic TTL cleanup to ensure reliable performance and memory efficiency.

## Use Cases

- Speed up static or semi-static endpoints
- Reduce load on database and external APIs
- Avoid redundant processing for frequent requests
