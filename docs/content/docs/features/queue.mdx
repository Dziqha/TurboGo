description: Background job system with memory and persistent file modes in TurboGo.

# Configure Queue

TurboGo includes a built-in background job system for running asynchronous tasks with support for in-memory and persistent file storage.

---

##  Initialization

Initialize the queue system in your main function:

```go
ctx := app.InitEmptyEngine()
app.WithQueue(ctx)
controller.QueueWorker(ctx)
```

---

##  How It Works

- Jobs are pushed using `Enqueue(topic, data)` to be processed later.
- Each queue is identified by a topic string.
- Workers process jobs from either memory, storage, or both.

---

##  Example Usage

###  Enqueue to Memory (Fast, volatile)

```go
if err := c.MustQueue().Memory.Enqueue("user:welcome-email", payload); err != nil {
    c.JSON(500, map[string]string{"error": "Queue error"})
    return
}
```

###  Enqueue to Storage (Durable, file-based)

```go
if err := c.MustQueue().Storage.Enqueue("user:welcome-email", payload); err != nil {
    c.JSON(500, map[string]string{"error": "Queue error"})
    return
}
```

###  Default Behavior

When using:

```go
c.MustQueue().EnqueueAll("user:welcome-email", payload)
```

TurboGo will enqueue the job to **both** memory and storage (combined mode).

---

###  Registering Workers

TurboGo allows flexible worker registration depending on delivery mode:

```go
// Memory worker only
c.Queue.Memory.RegisterWorker("user:welcome-email", SendWelcomeEmailWorker)

// Storage worker only
c.Queue.Storage.RegisterWorker("user:welcome-email", SendWelcomeEmailWorker)

// Both memory + storage (default)
c.Queue.RegisterWorkerAll("user:welcome-email", SendWelcomeEmailWorker)
```

### Worker example:

```go
func SendWelcomeEmailWorker(data []byte) error {
	var input CreateUserInput
	json.Unmarshal(data, &input)
	fmt.Printf("ðŸ‘· Queue Worker: %s <%s>\n", input.Name, input.Email)
	return nil
}
```

---

##  Configuration Modes

TurboGo Queue supports 3 modes:

- **Memory Only**: Temporary, best for speed in dev/test.
- **File Storage Only**: Ensures durability across restarts.
- **Combined** *(default)*: Uses both for speed + safety.

---

##  Behind the Scenes

TurboGo Queue uses a dual-layer system:

- **Memory**: Fast, buffered in-RAM processing
- **Storage**: Durable JSON logs for crash recovery

Jobs can be enqueued to either or both layers.  
Automatic cleanup runs every 10 minutes, removing jobs older than 24 hours.

---

##  Auto Cleanup

TurboGo automatically cleans up old queue files:

- **Interval**: every `10 * time.Minute`
- **Retention**: deletes jobs older than `24 * time.Hour`

> No manual intervention needed.

---

## Use Cases

- Email delivery (welcome, verification)
- Background processing (thumbnails, reports)
- Asynchronous workflows
