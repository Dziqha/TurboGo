description: Structured and colorful request logging for TurboGo web apps.

#  Configure Logger

TurboGo includes a built-in structured logger for HTTP requests with readable and colorized output.

---

##  Initialization

The logger is enabled automatically when the app starts:

```go
app := TurboGo.New()
```

To disable logging:

```go
core.DisableLogger = true
```

---

##  How It Works

- Logs every HTTP request with method, path, status, and timestamp.
- Displays extra debug info like caching decisions.
- Colorized output in terminal to improve readability during development.

---

##  Example Log Output

```log
ðŸš€ TurboGo [2025-07-13 06:17:22] â†’ POST    /api/users                [201] 
[DEBUG] 2025-07-13 06:17:22 - [CACHE] DISABLED: POST /api/users
```

Each log entry includes:

- Timestamp
- HTTP method and route
- Status code
- Optional debug lines (e.g., `[CACHE]` info)

---

## Use Cases

- Monitor HTTP traffic during development
- Understand cache behavior per route
- Debug request flow, performance, and route hits
