# Configure Logger

TurboGo includes a built-in structured logger that prints HTTP request logs in a clean and colorized format.  
Logging is useful during development for observing route hits, debugging, and performance tracing.

---

## Initialization

By default, logger is **enabled automatically** when the app starts:

```go
func main() {
	app := TurboGo.New()
	app.Get("/", func(ctx *core.Context) {
		ctx.Text(200, "Hello, world!")
	})
}
````

To **disable** logging globally, set the following **before starting the app**:

```go
func main() {
	core.DisableLogger = true // 🔇 Turn off logging
	app := TurboGo.New()
	app.Get("/", func(ctx *core.Context) {
		ctx.Text(200, "Logging disabled!")
	})
}
```

> 🛈 Logging must be disabled **before** any request is handled.

---

## How It Works

TurboGo's logger prints structured logs for each request with the following format:

```log
🌀 TurboGo [05:50:35] GET / [200]
```

Each log includes:

* ✅ Timestamp (`[HH:MM:SS]`)
* ✅ HTTP Method (`GET`, `POST`, etc.)
* ✅ Path (`/`, `/api`, etc.)
* ✅ Status code (e.g. `[200]`, `[404]`)
* ✅ Colored output for improved readability

---

## Example Log Output

```
🌀 TurboGo [12:03:11] GET /             [200]
🌀 TurboGo [12:03:13] POST /api/user    [201]
🌀 TurboGo [12:03:15] GET /not-found    [404]
```

Color coding:

* `200–299` → ✅ Green
* `300–399` → 📘 Cyan
* `400–499` → ⚠️ Yellow
* `500–599` → ❌ Red

## Use Cases

* 👀 Monitor HTTP traffic during development
* 🐞 Debug route access, timing, and status codes
* ⚙️ Quickly spot routing errors or unexpected behavior
* 🧪 Performance profiling and access audit
