description: Lightweight publish/subscribe system for in-memory event messaging in TurboGo.
---

# Configure Pubsub

TurboGo includes an in-memory publish/subscribe (pubsub) system for event-driven communication between components.

---

##  Structure Integration

Pubsub is initialized in `main.go` via:

```go
ctx := app.InitEmptyEngine()
app.WithPubsub(ctx)
go controller.PubsubWorker(ctx)
```

---

##  How It Works

- Publish messages with `Publish(topic, data)`
- Listeners consume messages per topic
- Supports delivery via memory, storage, or both

---

##  Example Usage

### Publish an event:

```go
// Memory only
c.MustPubsub().Memory.Publish("user.created", payload)

// Storage only
c.MustPubsub().Storage.Publish("user.created", payload)

// Both (default)
c.MustPubsub().PublishAll("user.created", payload)
```

### Register a subscriber:

Subscribe to events using:

```go
// Memory only
ch := c.Pubsub.Memory.Subscribe("user.created")

// Storage only
ch := c.Pubsub.Storage.Subscribe("user.created")

// Both (default)
ch := c.Pubsub.SubscribeAll("user.created")
```


### Handling events example:

```go
for msg := range ch {
	if err := OnUserCreated(msg); err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Error processing pubsub message: %v\n", err)
	}
}
```

---

## Behind the Scenes

TurboGo Pubsub supports two delivery layers:

- **Memory**: Real-time broadcast via channels
- **Storage**: Persistent logs for reliable delivery

Messages can be published to either or both.  
Old messages are auto-deleted every 10 minutes if older than 24 hours.

---

##  Configuration Modes

- **Memory Only** – Real-time and fast
- **Storage Only** – Durable and replayable
- **Memory + Storage** *(default)* – Combines both

---

##  Auto Cleanup

Stored messages are cleaned up automatically:

- **Interval**: every `10 * time.Minute`
- **Older Than**: `24 * time.Hour`

> Ensures efficient storage usage.

---

##  Use Cases

- Real-time internal event broadcasting
- Triggering follow-up processes (e.g. welcome email after registration)
- Decoupled architecture for in-app modules
