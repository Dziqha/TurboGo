# Configure Routing

TurboGo provides a flexible and high-performance routing system inspired by popular Go frameworks.

---

##  Version

> This documentation refers to **TurboGo Routing v1**.

---

##  Basic Example

```go
app := TurboGo.New()

app.Get("/hello", func(c *core.Context) {
    c.Text(200, "Hello, World!")
})
```

---

##  Route Structure

TurboGo uses clear method-based route definitions:

- `app.Get(path, handler)`
- `app.Post(path, handler)`
- `app.Put(path, handler)`
- `app.Delete(path, handler)`
- And more...

---

## Grouping Routes

Group routes under a common prefix:

```go
group := app.Group("/api")
group.Get("/users", UserListHandler)
group.Post("/users", CreateUserHandler)
```
