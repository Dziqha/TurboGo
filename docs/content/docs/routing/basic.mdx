# Configure Routing

TurboGo provides a flexible and high-performance routing system inspired by popular Go frameworks.
At its core, TurboGo uses a custom **Tiered Zero-Copy Routing (TZCR)** engine that separates **static**, **parametric**, and **wildcard** routes into different tiers for ultra-fast resolution.

Unlike traditional routers, TurboGo precompiles handler chains, passes context using a **zero-copy** strategy, and avoids unnecessary allocations â€” all designed to optimize for concurrency and minimal latency.

> ðŸ§ª In internal benchmarks, TurboGo consistently outperforms popular frameworks like Gin and Fiber in routing-heavy workloads.

##  Basic Example

```go
app := TurboGo.New()

app.Get("/hello", func(c *core.Context) {
    c.Text(200, "Hello, World!")
})
```

##  Route Structure

TurboGo uses clear method-based route definitions:

- `app.Get(path, handler)`
- `app.Post(path, handler)`
- `app.Put(path, handler)`
- `app.Delete(path, handler)`
- And more...

## Grouping Routes

Group routes under a common prefix:

```go
group := app.Group("/api")
group.Get("/users", UserListHandler)
group.Post("/users", CreateUserHandler)
```
